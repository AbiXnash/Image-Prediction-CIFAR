# **Project Title:** CIFAR-10 Image Prediction

### **Description:**
This GitHub repository hosts my comprehensive CIFAR-10 image prediction project, which I completed as part of the SmartKnower program. CIFAR-10 is a widely used dataset in computer vision, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images from 10 different classes. The primary goal of this project was to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying these images into their respective categories.

### **Key Features and Highlights:**

1. **Deep Learning Models:** I've implemented and fine-tuned several deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to achieve high accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Extensive data preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance the model's performance, including data augmentation, normalization, and one-hot encoding of labels.

3. **Model Evaluation:** I have thoroughly evaluated the models using various performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to provide a comprehensive assessment of their capabilities.

4. **Visualization:** The repository includes visualization tools to display sample images, model predictions, and training/validation curves, allowing for a better understanding of model behavior.

5. **Model Checkpoints:** Checkpoints of the trained models are provided, making it easy to reproduce results and continue training if necessary.

6. **Jupyter Notebooks:** You can find Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations of the project's steps, making it accessible for learning and understanding.

7. **Dependencies:** A list of required libraries and dependencies is provided to help set up the project environment.
